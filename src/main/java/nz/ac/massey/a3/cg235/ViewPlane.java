    Class to represent the view plane for the virtual camera. Here the view plane is
    modelled as a planar surface parallel to the xy plane (in camera coordinates) and located
    at a distance on the optical axis (ie z-axis) of the camera. The positive optical axis points
    towards the scene. The projection employs a 1-point perspective.

    The view plane is divided into pixels
